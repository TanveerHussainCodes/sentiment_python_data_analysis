# sentiment_python_data_analysis
“Project Description”

Task A: Data Cleaning
A1. Handle Missing Data: Identify and deal with missing values (remove or impute).


A2. Remove Duplicates: Find and eliminate any duplicate rows.


A3. Fix Inconsistencies: Standardize inconsistent data entries (e.g., case issues in categorical columns).


Task B: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
B1. Understand the Data: Review the first few rows and check data types.


B2. Data Distribution: Visualize the distribution of numerical columns (e.g., histograms or boxplots).


B3. Relationships Between Variables: Explore correlations or relationships between variables using plots.


B4. Categorical Data Exploration: Visualize frequencies of categorical columns (e.g., bar plots).


Task C: Data Preprocessing for Modeling
C1. Feature Engineering: Create new features.


C2. Scaling/Normalization: Scale or normalize numerical data.

Task D: Data Visualization and Dashboarding
D1. Static Visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn


Use matplotlib.pyplot for basic plots such as histograms, line charts, bar plots, and scatter plots.


Use seaborn for advanced statistical visualizations like:


distribution and outlier detection.


correlation matrices.


pairwise relationships.


D2. Interactive Visualizations using Plotly


Use plotly.express and plotly.graph_objects to build interactive charts such as:


Interactive bar and line charts


Hoverable and zoomable scatter plots


D3. Identify Trends


Visualize time-based or group-based trends in the dataset.


Use group-by operations to summarize trends over time or categories.


Generate insights from these trends visually to guide decisions.


D4. Dash Application for Web-based Interaction


Build a Dash dashboard to allow users to interact with visual data.


Include dynamic elements like dropdown filters, sliders, and interactive graphs.


Enable viewing of:


Distributions of variables


Relationships between key features


Interactive correlation analysis


Category breakdowns and trends
